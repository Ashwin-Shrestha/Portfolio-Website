            Technology has developed a lot since the past. Thinking about how television was the only source of
            entertainment at one point tells us how much we have developed in the past 20 years or so. If we observe the
            things around us right now, I assure you that you have at least 3 to 5 things that is created through
            advancement of technology. Nowadays, we have cell phones, laptops, PC, an LED TV, virtual reality and so much
            more that probably one cannot even think of. If someone told me 10 years that I could order food or any other
            things straight from a small device, I would be thinking that either the guy is mad or lying. But now, at
            present context, I wouldn’t even be surprised if there was a flying vehicle. This is because the world we live
            in right now has prospered a lot after the advancement in science and technology.
            <br>
            <br>
            I know I have talked a lot about technology, and I think you may have heard it a lot as well but what is
            technology ? How can we define technology? According to Oxford Dictionary, “Technology is the application of
            scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry.” So, from the definition we can take that
            technology is all the application made and used which is possible due to the development in science. Now, I
            have listed a lot of things made possible due to the advancement in technology but how has it affected us, the
            human beings.
            <br>
            <br>
            Technology has affected us more in a good way than in a bad way. As we already know, the world today is not in
            a good phase. As we all know about the pandemic that his hit the world in the recent years, I would like you
            to think about what we would be doing if the pandemic had hit the world in the 2000s. We would have no source
            of entertainment inside the house, except for an old TV that shows the same things twice a day sometimes. We
            would not be able to go outside of the house so we would be left inside a house with no social life, no
            education and basically, we would be wasting our time. But, now due to the technology nowadays, we can study
            from home via online conference applications, we can learn as well as watch videos to entertain ourselves from
            video streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. So, if we think having a pandemic now is
            bad, think about what would’ve happened if it was in the past. So, you can see how much technology has
            affected us. Now, technology is not just used as a source of entertainment, it has also helped in various
            fields. One example I can give you is the Space X aircraft launch.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am pretty sure everyone has heard about Elon Musk, “The real-life Iron Man”, who can make anything possible.
            Space X, a spacecraft made by Elon Musk. If we have studied about rocket or watched any lift-off video of a
            rocket, we know that the rocket if lifted to the ground. However, the rocket doesn’t land back to the earth
            and gets ejected out of the space shuttle. But Elon Musk created the SpaceX which could land the rocket back
            again. Now, you may say why is that a significant change? Well, the materials that are used in making the
            rocket cost millions of dollars. But, due to the Space X landing, the cost of making the rocket goes down as
            we can use the same part again as well as the materials are conserved. So, technology has affected us various
            ways and the advancement of technology has made the world a better place to live.
