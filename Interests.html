          For the start, I would like to say, I am a very introvert type of person who really has interest in things
          that are not so cool to the outer world. I have a curiosity to learn many things but not have interest in
          those things. So, I would say my interests are limited. I have wrote down some of my interests which I could
          think of down below, hope you take a look at it if you want to know more about me.

            Travelling
            <br>
            <p class="para">
              Travelling for me is the best thing that the world can offer. Travelling has helped me a lot in refreshing
              myself from all the burdens I have faced till now. Once a while, when I am stressed, I go on a journey to
              somewhere with friends or parents or even alone sometimes. My main goal in life is to earn money so that I
              can travel every place in the world. So, you can just say that I am living my life right now mainly to
              travel a lot and go to different places. Travelling helps me know how little the problems in our life is
              compared to the world and helps me think on how I can solve a problem. So, the first thing that I would
              like to do is to travel and I consider this as my interest not just hobby. Below, I have kept some photos
              I have clicked of the beautiful places I have travelled till now as a slide. Do give it a watch if you got
              time

            <p class="para">
              As having a computer as a friend from childhood, I have grown to love computers a lot. So, everything
              about computer fascinates me. So , programming is one of the main things of computer that fascinates me.
              With programming, you can do anything in a computer. You can build a game, you can build an application
              for something. For me, programming is something that can create or bring something wonderful to the world.
              For example, If we didn’t had a web browser, I don’t think we would be able to surf the internet like we
              are doing now. So, programming fascinates me a lot and I often code when I am free or have no work. It’s
              an interest I would like to make a job.
            </p>

          <li class="topic">Gaming
            <br>
            <p class="para">
              As said above, I love computers so if a person loves computers, they must love games. So, I am pretty
              interested in playing games as well. Although, I have played games for my whole life. I am more interested
              in competitive shooting games like CS:GO, Valorant, Apex Legends and many others. When I play these games,
              I concentrate on it like how Tom Cruise is concentrated in Mission Impossible when he enters the vault. If
              you haven’t seen that movie, I recommend you see it. So, I really love playing games and I really love how
              the dynamic of a game works. So, basically I am a tech-nerd who loves to travel a lot.
